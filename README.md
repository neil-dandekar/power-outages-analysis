## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     | Count |
| :---------- | ----: |
| Fall 2020   |     3 |
| Winter 2021 |     2 |
| Spring 2021 |     6 |
| Summer 2021 |     4 |
| Fall 2021   |    55 |
